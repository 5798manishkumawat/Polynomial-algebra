# Polynomial-algebra
Using  linked list and array(easy one) seperately we will try to make basic algebraic operations  +,-,/,*.
Both Array and Linked list programs have different files,you choose any one of them to work on and pull request.
We will use only C language for this project as we have to club all this operations in a single source code.
Till now i only upload files of addition operation just to intialise the project rest of them will be uploaded soon,  
I will keep updating changes wherever necessary.
